# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
1. Introduction
In this project, I decide to analyze the credit card transactions data. The data can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.
The goal of this project is to build a model that can detect fraud transactions.
I will be using four machine learning models, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost and compare their accuracy by using sensitivity vs specificty curve.
also called Receiver Operating Characteristc (ROC) curve. We begin by importing the necessary libraries and loading data from the dataset.
